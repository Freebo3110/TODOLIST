# To-Do List App

*****************
## About
This is a simple To-Do list application built using React. It allows users to add tasks to a list and delete them when they are completed.

This is a basic app to learn how to work with classes. In the future, I would like to add the ability to save to-do lists for each date so that you can view historical data.
